# Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis
## Overview
Data analysis for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company transitioning to an online platform. This repository contains SQL queries, data visualizations, and insights addressing key business questions, aiding the company's 2020 strategy.
## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to assist Rockbuster Stealth LLC in formulating a strategic launch plan for their new online video rental service. This will be achieved by leveraging comprehensive data analysis to garner insights into their existing movie rental operations. Specifically, we aim to:

- Migrate all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) to facilitate easier querying and analysis.
- Analyze the data using SQL to derive answers to critical business questions posed by the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
- Understand the intricacies of various data points to ensure a holistic view of Rockbuster's operations.
- Present the analytical findings in a concise and clear manner to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board, enabling them to make data-driven decisions for their 2020 company strategy.
## Data:
The project is built upon a rich dataset that spans across 15 tables. These tables include "Payment", which captures the payment details; "Rental", documenting the rental transactions; and "Films by Actors", listing the movies associated with each actor. The "Inventory" table tracks the available movies, while "Film Categories" classifies films into different genres. The database also houses details about "Customers", the "Staff" managing the operations, and the "Store" information. Additionally, there are tables dedicated to the "Actor" profiles, individual "Films", and their "Address" details. The dataset further categorizes movies by "Movie Languages". Geographic data is neatly organized into "Cities" and "Countries" tables, providing a holistic view of the movie rental landscape.
